*** DO NOT USE / THIS IS OUTDATED (and was probably never the best approach) ***
Shopify has evolved a lot since this was written and new plugins and methods are available

Simple Javascript for Shopify that searches for the customer tag "Wholesale" | If found, it will show wholesale products from the store, [Works best when you add a wholesale version of the same product but add '(Wholsale)' to the product title]. If the customer tag is not found, the script will remove the wholesale products from the DOM.
